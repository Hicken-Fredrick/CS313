    <h3 class="tech">Everything Technology</h3>
    <p class="techInfo">Technology is evolving at an amazing pace every single day, and the information availible to us grows in equal measure. It wasn't that long ago that someone may of been able to be a scientist of many field, but now? Now it can take nearly alifetime to become a master of a single field and specialization is growing more and more required for those tasks that require strange or obscure knowledge. All of this seems to come straight out of an Asiimov novel and yet, I can't stop looking at these things in wonder, who would of though back when 1mb was a huge hard drive that we would have 1tb NVME drives that can R/W fast than 100x the speed of old hard disk drives. I wonder what tomorrow holds?</p>

    <h3 class="games">Video Games</h3>
    <p class="gamesInfo">There are a great deal of games out there worth playing in my opinion. Some of them live by the mertis of their story like those this image comes from, a small title called "Undertale". Despite all of its technical shortcomings and outdated standards it was able to reach a massive audience. To this day it's still remembered fondly by many including myself where games that focused purely on graphical fidelity have drifted by the wayside. Rarely there is a game with great technology and story driving it, I believe that last one I saw was "Mass Effect 2" a beautiful game with a rich world and frankly some of my favorite combat of any game.</p>

    <h3 class="books">BOOKS!</h3>
    <p class="booksInfo">Books will always have a special place in my heart and my mind. There are so many adventures I would of never taken had it not been through those passages. One of my absolute favorite series is pictured here called "Abhorsen" If you haven't read it, you should fix that. It's set in a fantasy world and the author does an amazing job at world building, put that togethor with an interesting mythology to draw from and to a western audience it feels incredly foreign in all the best ways. Some of my other favorites that all deserve a read are: The Mistborn Trilogy, Kingkiller Chronicles, and The Chronicles of Narnia. </p>
